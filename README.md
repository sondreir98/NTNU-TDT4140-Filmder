# Filmder

Filmder is a social platform designed to simplify movie selection among friends and acquaintances. The platform allows users to easily find and choose movies using recommendations, filtering options, and a swipe function that makes exploring different movies fun and intuitive. With Filmder, users can mark which movies they like and dislike, create movie nights with friends, and see which movies everyone at a gathering can agree on. Filmder facilitates a simple and social experience where you can avoid long discussions about movie selection and instead quickly find a movie everyone wants to see.

By offering multiple filtering and recommendation features, Filmder helps customize the movie selection to the individual user's taste and preferences. The platform creates an engaging experience by facilitating a fun and social process of finding a movie, while also allowing you to keep track of which movies you and your friends have enjoyed.
